The Operatin System performs many functions on a computer, but one of the main ones is to be the interface between the hardware and the software. The Operating System uses device drivers, some built-in and some provided by the hardware vendors, to interface with the hardware. It uses these to accept input and provide output, as necessary, to the physical components of the computer. It then accepts input from and provides output to the different software packages and applications installed on the computer. This saves the hardware vendors from having to customize their drivers for every different software application out there, they only have to work with the Operating System; and the software vendors don't have to worry about how they're going to get input and where they're going to send output, they just need to work with the Operating System.
