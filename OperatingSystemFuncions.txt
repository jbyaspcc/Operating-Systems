The Operatig System performs many functions on a computer, but one of the main ones is to be the interface between the hardware and the software. The Operating System uses device drivers, some built-in and some provided by the hardware vendors, to interface with the hardware. It uses these to accept input and provide output, as necessary, to the physical components of the computer. It then accepts input from and provides output to the different software packages and applications installed on the computer. This saves the hardware vendors from having to customize their drivers for every different software application out there, they only have to work with the Operating System; and the software vendors don't have to worry about how they're going to get input and where they're going to send output, they just need to work with the Operating System.

The Operating system also keeps track of where data is located, in regards to the hardware. It uses it's Memory Manager to keep track of what data is being stored in the volatile memory. It also uses it's File Manager to remember where on the hard drive the data and applications are being stored. Usually this storage information is called a File Allocation Table, or just a File System.

The Operating System has a Processor Manager that helps to ensure the best usage of the Central Processing Unit (CPU). It keeps track of what's going to and coming from the processor. It also helps to schedule the items being processed to keep the computer working in it's most efficient manner. It also monitors the processor to ensure that no bad code is allowed to get stuck in the processor and cause the processor to ignore other duties.
